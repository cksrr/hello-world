# hello-world

They’re asking me why I want to sell books. Why do I want to sell books? I don’t really. I’m more interested in earning money. Selling books just happens to be a bi-product of my need to possess cash. What should I say? That I find selling books interesting? I can’t imagine it being any more interesting than selling anything else; much the same as selling say, flower pots or frozen peas. What’s in the books is interesting but selling them…?

The silence has continued for too long. They’re looking at me expectantly. Should I be completely honest? No, that wouldn’t go down too well. Although it is kinda de facto that people only really work for money, telling the interviewers that suggests that I don’t have a care in the world for books. I need to think of something, quick! Oh heck!

“Secretly, for a number of years, I have been working on a masterplan. It is only now that I can begin to put this plan into operation. It all begins with reading, for books are little repositories of knowledge. The can take you to the most magical of places and give insights into the human soul. They can make you laugh, they can make you cry. They entertain and educate. But most of all, books make you think. And it’s thinking that makes us who we are.”

“By selling books, I hope to encourage people to start using their grey matter. If all goes according to plan, this will kick-start the beginning of a free-thinking and radical society that will throw off the yoke of intellectual oppression and lead to the establishment of a world utopia.”

Stunned silence. Okay, maybe that wasn’t the best thing to say…
